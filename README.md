# How to create dot plots in Python
## A little tweak to classic Seaborn scatterplot 

In this repository you can find how to create a dot plot using Python and Seaborn package. Dot plots are not included in Seaborn, but you can use a little tweak to the scatterplot and convert it with few simple steps. 

If you are interested just in the code, you should check the [Python script](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/DotPlotPython/blob/master/movie_ratings.py) used to create a dot plot of movies I watched sorted by release year and rating. [Raw dataset](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/DotPlotPython/blob/master/ratings.csv) will help you recreate my findings.

You should also read this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/DotPlotPython/blob/master/How%20to%20create%20dot%20plots%20in%20Python.ipynb), which explains how the loop let to convert scatterplot to a dot plot.

Here is the final chart:
